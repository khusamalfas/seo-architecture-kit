# Internal Linking Framework

## Objectives
- Distribute authority from strong pages to strategic targets.
- Help users discover relevant content.
- Reinforce semantic relationships between pages.

## Link Types
- **Structural** – navigation, breadcrumbs, footers.
- **Contextual** – in-body links in paragraphs and lists.
- **Supporting** – Tier-3 content linking into Tier-1 services.
- **Sibling** – related services/articles at the same depth.

## Rules
- Every new page must receive internal links from at least 2–3 relevant pages.
- Use descriptive, natural anchors – not over-optimised spam.
- Prioritise linking from high-traffic / high-authority pages to key commercial pages.
