# Canonical Strategy

## Goals
- Consolidate signals per intent/cluster.
- Avoid cannibalisation from near-duplicate URLs.
- Keep a single primary URL per topic, per language/GEO context.

## Rules
- Every indexable page must have a self-referencing canonical.
- UTM and other parameters must not create new canonical URLs.
- Paginated sets use canonical to the main listing or self, depending on strategy.
