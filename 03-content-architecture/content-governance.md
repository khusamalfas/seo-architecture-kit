# Content Governance

## Objectives
- Ensure all content supports strategy, not random publishing.
- Keep tone, structure and quality consistent.
- Enable safe scaling via templates and workflows.

## Roles
- **SEO Owner** – defines strategy, clusters, and priorities.
- **Content Lead** – controls briefs, structure, and editorial alignment.
- **Experts** – provide correctness and depth where needed (E-E-A-T).
- **Writers** – produce drafts based on briefs and templates.

## Rules
- Each URL must have a documented cluster and intent.
- No content is created without a brief.
- Every article / service page follows an approved template.
- Updates are logged: who changed what and why.
