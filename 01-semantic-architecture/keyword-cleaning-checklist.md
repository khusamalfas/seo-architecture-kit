# Keyword Cleaning Checklist

Use this checklist before clustering:

- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Remove obvious brand-only navigational queries (unless brand SEO is in scope)
- [ ] Remove technical noise and random junk terms
- [ ] Unify frequent spelling variants where possible
- [ ] Normalise spacing, case, punctuation
- [ ] Remove queries with no interpretable intent
- [ ] Tag branded vs non-branded
- [ ] Tag localised vs generic
