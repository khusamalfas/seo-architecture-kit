# Intent Taxonomy

We classify intents on two levels: **type** and **stage**.

## Intent Types
- **Informational** – learn about a problem, concept, cause, symptom, method.
- **Commercial** – compare options, understand solutions, features, providers.
- **Transactional** – act now: buy, book, sign up, contact.
- **Navigational** – reach a specific brand, product, or page.
- **Local** – find something “near me” or in a specific city/area.

## Funnel Stage
- **Awareness** – problem exploration.
- **Consideration** – evaluating categories/providers.
- **Decision** – choosing provider/offer.
- **Post-purchase** – usage, support, extension.

Each keyword in the semantic set must have:
- `intent_type`
- `funnel_stage`
- optional `geo_tag`
