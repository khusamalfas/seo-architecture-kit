# Clustering Methodology

This document describes the step-by-step process used to move from raw keywords to production-ready semantic clusters.

## 1. Input Sources
- SEO tools (e.g. Ahrefs / SEMrush / Serpstat export)
- PPC search term reports
- Google Search Console queries
- Competitor ranking keywords
- Internal search logs

## 2. Cleaning Rules
- Remove pure navigational brand queries (unless strategic).
- Normalise plural/singular where appropriate.
- Merge identical queries across tools.
- Remove ultra-low value queries (no intent, random noise).

## 3. Intent Classification
For each query, define:
- **Primary intent:** informational, commercial, transactional, navigational, local.
- **Stage:** awareness, consideration, decision, retention.
- **Business fit:** high / medium / low.

## 4. SERP-Based Clustering
- Pull top 10–20 results for sample/head terms.
- Group queries that share very similar SERPs (same pages ranking).
- Avoid over-fragmentation: prefer fewer, stronger clusters.

## 5. Cluster Output Structure
Each final cluster should have:
- Cluster name (human readable)
- Representative keyword(s)
- Full keyword list (ordered by priority/volume)
- Target URL (or planned URL)
- Page type (service / category / article / FAQ / local page)
- Mapping to content backlog / roadmap.
